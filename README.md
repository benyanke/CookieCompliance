# CookieCompliance

Forked from the plugins listed below to allow the user to specify additional details about the cookie set by the 
plugin: cookie name, cookie domain, exp. time, path, among other things.

This allows users to integrate with other applications on the same domain by specifying the cookie name, to ensure a user
who has cleared the banner does not see it again on the other applications (and vice versa)
